# UOW Event Booking System
A web application that simulates an event booking system for my university, using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. The system provides the following functions:

* Event creation and management: Staff-level users can create a new event, or edit the attributes on an existing event.

* Event booking: System users can view the list of events, make a booking, and modify or cancel an existing booking.

* User management: System users can view their profile including username, email, phone number and activity log (history) and edit the profile.

__Register for a staff account to access all features above.__
